### Problem Link 
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-list/

### Note
This problem is straight forward if you know [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort).

- Use `Conquer and Divide` to split list recursively.
- When list length is 2 or 1, sort list.
- Merge sub lists back to list.

Time complexity is `O(N log N)`.
